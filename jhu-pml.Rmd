### Objective

The final assignment of this [Practical Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning/home/welcome) is to build a classification model. The model is based off exercise accelerometer data from Groupware\@LES' [Human Activity Recognition](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) project, where participants were instructed to perform different lifts correctly __*and*__ incorrectly. Trained on a predefined training data set, the model should be able to accurately predict if a lift was perfomed correctly or incorrectly on a 20 observation test set.
